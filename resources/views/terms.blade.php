      <h3>The ten basic principles of a broad mass base</h3>
      <ol style="text-align: justify; line-height: 50px;">
        <li>The identity of the State of Sudan, with its internationally recognized geographical borders, with all its ethnic components, cultural diversity, languages and religions, is Sudanese.</li>

        <li>The independence and impartiality of the judiciary without being influenced by any party, regardless of its authority, after the complete separation between the three powers (legislative, judicial, and executive) is a recognized basic principle for building a state of institutions and the rule of law that must be included in the permanent constitution of the state.</li>
         
        <li>Ending injustice and marginalization, dismantling unilateral and ethnographic domination and preventing its establishment in the opposite direction, while addressing all the structural and structural imbalances of the state in all institutions and reformulating them on true and just national foundations, and building a single professional army with those national standards with a national creed that protects the citizen, the state and the constitution.</li>

        <li>Institutionalization and transparency with the principle of accountability, and true nationalism in offering, behavior and actual practice within the organization.</li>

        <li>The federation of the state, believing in what the people see through real representation through legitimate and official ways or what the people impose by any means they see fit.</li>

        <li>The unity of Sudan, the state and the people, along the lines of the free will of the citizens of each region vliuntarily and freely, away from guardianship and false representation or the imposition of force of arms.</li>

        <li>The criterion of equal citizenship in all rights and duties within the Sudanese state is the birth within the Sudanese state in any of its regions, not the tribe or ethnicity.</li>

        <li>A free national economy away from external bequests, and dealing with the international community within the framework of integration based on common interests in development, and maintaining the sovereignty of the National Central Bank, free and independent from the grip of foreign pliicies.</li>

        <li>Limiting the rlie of the tribe and not invliving it in any pliitical or organizational work and placing it in the natural social path, criminalizing and refusing to deal on a tribal and ethnographic basis within the organization (while preserving the regional status legislated in the constitution), and adopting the principle of qualitative normativeness on the basis of competence, honesty and integrity in job tasks and organizational.</li>

        <li>We believe in free democracy, democratic action and the peaceful transfer of power, while excluding the military institution from pliitical action, and we reject and condemn military coups and foreign interference in the pliicies and affairs of the state.</li>
